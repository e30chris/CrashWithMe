## Files

- `cmd/main.go`: This file is the entry point of the application. It initializes the web server and sets up the routes.

- `internal/handlers/handler.go`: This file exports a struct `Handler` which contains methods to handle different HTTP requests. It interacts with the database through the `models` package.

- `internal/models/model.go`: This file exports a struct `Model` which represents a data model in the application. It contains methods to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

- `internal/db/db.go`: This file exports a struct `DB` which handles the connection to the PostgreSQL database. It provides methods to perform database operations such as querying and inserting data.

- `internal/routes/routes.go`: This file exports a function `SetupRoutes` which sets up the routes for the web application. It uses the `Handler` to handle different routes and HTTP methods.

- `config/config.go`: This file exports a struct `Config` which contains configuration settings for the application, such as the database connection details.

- `go.mod`: This file is the module definition file for Go. It lists the dependencies of the project.

- `go.sum`: This file contains the expected cryptographic checksums of the module dependencies.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the PostgreSQL database and update the configuration in `config/config.go`.
3. Run the application using the command `go run cmd/main.go`.
4. Access the web application at `http://localhost:8080`.
